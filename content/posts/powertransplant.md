## My reflection on living abroad and not being able to go back

This is my first zine, **PowerTransplant**.

I made it for myself, and for people like me - those who left their home country for education, work, or love, and later realized that *going back is no longer a safe or simple option*.

For me, it started with a Fulbright scholarship in 2019, a PhD, and the belief that I would return home and give back what I learned.  
After 2022, that plan quietly stopped existing.

I don’t know for sure what would happen if I crossed the Russian border.  
Some people do. Some don’t.  
But I don’t want to play Russian roulette.

This zine is not about geopolitics.  
It’s about **home**, **exile**, and the strange feeling of belonging *nowhere and everywhere at once*.

I asked people from my community — people who also can’t go back — a few simple questions:
- What do you miss most from home?
- When was it hardest?
- What does “home” mean now?
- When did you last feel like you belonged?

Their answers are honest, quiet, sometimes contradictory.  
Just like this experience.

## Why I’m sharing this here

I’m used to publishing technical work — papers, datasets, code.  
This zine is different.

It’s still research, in a way.  
Just human-scale.

If it resonates with you, you’re not alone.
