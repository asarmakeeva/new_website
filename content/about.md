Hi, I’m **Anastasiia** — a **Machine Learning Engineer with a PhD**, working at the intersection of **computer vision, synthetic data, and reproducible research**.

I focus on building and evaluating ML systems for high-stakes domains, with particular experience in **medical imaging**, **generative models**, and **data-centric AI**. My work emphasizes rigor, interpretability, and reproducibility.

I am one of the contributors to **[T-SYNTH](https://github.com/DIDSR/tsynth-release)** — an open-source synthetic medical imaging dataset for breast cancer lesion detection, released in collaboration with the FDA and presented at **MICCAI 2025**.

I’m currently exploring roles in **machine learning engineering, computer vision or applied research**, where strong modeling meets real-world impact.

**Core tools:** PyTorch, JAX, Python, C++, Docker  
**Interests:** Computer vision, generative models, synthetic data, reproducible research
